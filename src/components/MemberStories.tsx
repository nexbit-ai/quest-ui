      story: 'A graduate of IIT in India and employee #8 at Stripe, Anurag joined SPC knowing only that he wanted to take on big problems. He built apps around healthcare, deep learning, and real-time communication, while helping other members with their projects. All this building and feedback revealed the opportunity for a new platform that could radically simplify DevOps. Render was born and subsequently has become one of the fastest growing tools in the developer ecosystem, raising $150M+ to date.',

      story: 'Amit joined SPC in 2021 after working on cutting-edge camera tech at Apple, driven by a fascination with NeRFs, a new way to turn photos into rich 3D models. As he explored the frontier, he saw a bigger shift comingâ€”the world is multi-modal, and AI will be too. That insight sparked Luma, where he\'s built state-of-the-art image, 3D, and video models powering a new generation of immersive, AI-native content. The company has since raised $150M+ to bring this vision to life.',
